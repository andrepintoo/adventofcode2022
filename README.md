# Advent of Code 2022 🎄

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)! This repository contains my journey and code, in which my objective was to get to learn a little bit more of Golang. 🗓️

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual programming event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). Every year during December, AoC releases a set of small programming puzzles every day from December 1st through December 25th. The challenges are fun, festive, and come in two parts, often building on each other.

Participants solve the puzzles in any language they prefer, aiming to complete as many days as possible.

## Language and Approach

All solutions in this repository are written in **Go** (Golang). Go was chosen for its simplicity, concurrency model, and performance. Each solution emphasizes readability and learning best practices in Go.

### Files
- **`main1.go`**: The main Go file containing the solution for day 1.
- **`main2.go`**: The main Go file containing the solution for day 2.
- **`input.txt`**: The actual puzzle input for the day, provided by Advent of Code.
- **`example.txt`**: Example input for testing, if provided.

## How to Run

To execute a day’s solution:

1. Navigate to the respective day’s folder:
   ```bash
    go run main1.go
    go run main2.go

The program will read the input from input.txt and output the solution to the console.

Checkmarks (✅) indicate completed parts, while question marks (❓) show days not yet started.

This repository is mainly for personal learning and tracking progress, but feel free to explore or leave suggestions. Every puzzle offers multiple ways to solve, so comparing approaches can be a great way to improve coding skills!
